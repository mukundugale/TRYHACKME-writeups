üìåPROTOCOLS AND SERVERS :
	
	‚ô¶Ô∏èTELNET :
		Telnet is a application layer protocol which is used to connect a virtual terminal to another computer. Using terminal ,a user can log into another computer to access
		terminal and perform malicious activities like start batch processes, do system administartion tasks remotely.
		
		This protocol is very simple. use command : telnet <targer-ip> 
		but in that when you enter this command a username and password field come so with correct user and pass will enter target terminal.Telnet is insecure when 
		we capturing via wireshark then this protocol gives a plaintext field which we write pass and username.
		so telnet is not longer secure option so ssh will become a secure option.
		
		command : telnet <target-ip>
	
	
	Questions :
	1)To which port will the telnet command with the default parameters try to connect?
	---> To connect : telnet 10.201.108.60
	Answer : 23
	
	
	‚ô¶Ô∏èHYPER-TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL :(HTTP) 
		HTTP are used for transfer the various web pages.Your web browser connect the web server and uses HTTP to requesting HTML pages and submitting form and upload files.
		when we use www you use HTTP protocol.
		HTTP protocol send credential as plaintext(not encrypted) so you can use telnet to communicate to web server and act as a web browser but you need to use HTTP related
		command so web browser can do it for you.
		
		using telnet we can retrieve web pages instead of your web browser . following steps :
		1)you need to connect to port 80 use command  : telnet 10.201.108.60 80
		2)next , you need to enter GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the page 
		3)final, you neet to provide host like host: telnet and press enter .
		
		The popular HTTP server(web server) following :
		1)nginx
		2)internet information server
		3)apache
		
		The popular HTTP client(web browser) following :
		1)firefox
		2)Google chrome
		3)microsoft edge
		
		
	Questions :
	1)Launch the attached VM. From the AttackBox terminal, connect using Telnet to 10.201.108.60 80 and retrieve the file flag.thm. What does it contain?
	---> To answer this question following command use:
	1) telnet 10.201.108.60 80
	2)GET /flag.thm HTTP/1.1
	3)host: telnet and press enter

	‚ô¶Ô∏èFILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL(FTP) :
		File transfer protocol was developed for transfer of file with different computer to different system. FTP send and receives as plaintext so we use telnet client to 
		communicate with FTP server and acts as a FTP client. following steps :
		1) type command on terminal : telnet 10.201.108.60 21 . in that we use ftp port 21 by default.
		2) enter USER frank and PASS D2xc9CgD .in that we logged in
		
		some command :
		1)STAT : to provide some added information.
		2)PASV : to switching the passive mode
		
		--ftp has 2 modes :
		Active : in the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server‚Äôs port 20.
		Passive : in the passive mode,he data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client‚Äôs port above port number 1023.
		
		3)TYPE A : to switching file transfer mode to ASCII mode.
		4)TYPE I : to switching file transfer mode to binary mode
		in that, we cannot transfer file using simple client like telnet because FTP creates a separate connection for file transfer.
		
		lets use actual ftp client to download the text file, type command ftp 10.201.108.60 and enter. then fill name and pass as USER frank and PASS D2xc9CgD and enter.
		it will open a ftp terminal like ftp> then enter ls command to see the text file .then type ascii to switch the ASCII mode and type get FILE_NAME and it will 
		download the file.
		
		FTP server and FTP client uses FTP protocol. there various FTP server software like vsftpd,proftpd and uFTP and FTP client like fillaZilla with GUI.some browser uses
		ftp client.
		
	Questions :
	1)Using an FTP client, connect to the VM and try to recover the flag file. What is the flag?

               Username: frank
               Password: D2xc9CgD
               
        ---> To answer this question, use following command :
        1)ftp 10.201.108.60
        2)enter name as frank and pass as D2xc9CgD
        3)type ls commmand and switch to ASCII mode.
        4)To retrive the file use get command like get FILE_NAME.

        ‚ô¶Ô∏èSIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL :(SMTP)
        	Email is most useful thing on the internet.Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:
        	1)mail user agent(MUA)
        	2)mail submission agent(MSA)
        	3)mail transfer agent(MTA)
        	4)mail delivery agent(MDA)
        
        	There are five steps that email is go to the recipient :
        	1)A mail user agent(MUA) or email client is send to a message. MUA is connected to MSA to send its message.
        	2)The mail submission agent(MSA) will check for error before transferring to mail transfer agent(MTA).
        	3)MTA send this message to MTA .MTA has also functioning of MSA.
        	4)MTA send this message to mail delivery agent(MDA).MTA has also functioning of MDA.
        	5)The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.
        	
        	The last two was confusing lets for example :
        	1)You (MUA) want to send postal mail.
                2)The post office employee (MSA) checks the postal mail for any issues before your local post office (MTA) accepts it.
                3)The local post office checks the mail destination and sends it to the post office (MTA) in the correct country.
                4)The post office (MTA) delivers the mail to the recipient mailbox (MDA).
                5)The recipient (MUA) regularly checks the mailbox for new mail. They notice the new mail, and they take it.
                
                we need to follow a protocol to communicate with an HTTP server, and we need to rely on email protocols to talk with an MTA and an MDA. The protocols are:
                1) simple mail transfer protocol(smtp)
                2)post office protocol version 3(pop3)
                3)internet message access protocol(imap)
                
                Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to communicate with an MTA server. Because SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption, 
                we can use a basic Telnet client to connect to an SMTP server and act as an email client (MUA) sending a message.
		SMTP server listens on port 25 by default. To see basic communication with an SMTP server, we used Telnet to connect to it. Once connected, we issue helo hostname 
                and then start typing our email.
                
        Questions :
        1)Using the AttackBox terminal, connect to the SMTP port of the target VM. What is the flag that you can get?
        ---> use command :telnet 10.201.108.60 25
        Answer : THM{5b31ddfc0c11d81eba776e983c35e9b5}
        
        
        
        ‚ô¶Ô∏èPOST OFFICE PROTOCOL 3(POP3) :
        	post office protocol 3 is used for downloading email messages from mail delivery agent(MDA).The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, 
        	downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.
        	
        	for ex, a user want to download email messages then you want to connect pop3 server pop3 uses default port 110.then user will authenticates with his username and 
        	password.then use STAT command to know that how many message are there . in that it will give in format +OK 1 179 where format like +OK nn mm.in that nn is 
        	the size of numbers of email messages are present and mm is the size of the inbox in octects(byte). lIST command will list provided a list of new messages
        	on the server, and RETR 1 retrieved the first message in the list. 
        	
        	
        	In general, your mail client (MUA) will connect to the POP3 server (MDA), authenticate, and download the messages. Although the communication using the
        	POP3 protocol will be hidden behind a sleek interface, similar commands will be issued, as shown in the Telnet session.
        	
        Questions :
        1)Connect to the VM (10.201.108.60) at the POP3 port. Authenticate using the username frank and password D2xc9CgD. What is the response you get to STAT?
        ---> use command : telnet 10.201.108.60 110  and then use command STAT.
        Answer : +OK 0 0
        2)How many email messages are available to download via POP3 on 10.201.108.60?
        ---> 0
        
        
        ‚ô¶Ô∏èINTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL(IMAP) :
        	Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices 
        	(and mail clients).we use Telnet to connect to the IMAP server‚Äôs default port, and then we authenticate using LOGIN username password. IMAP requires each
        	command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply. So we added c1, then c2, and so on. Then we listed our mail folders using LIST "" "*",
        	before checking if we have any new messages in the inbox using EXAMINE INBOX.
        	
        	t is clear that IMAP sends the login credentials in cleartext, as we can see in the command LOGIN frank D2xc9CgD. Anyone watching the network traffic would 
        	be able to know Frank‚Äôs username and password.
        	
        Questions :
        1)What is the default port used by IMAP?
        ---> 143 
        you ca also use command not for that question to generally use this protocol : telnet 10.201.108.60 143

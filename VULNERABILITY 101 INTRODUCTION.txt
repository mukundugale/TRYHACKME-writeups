📌VULNERABILITY 101 :
	
	♦️INTRODUCTION TO VULNERABILITIES :
		A vulnerability in cybersecurity define as a weakness or flaw in design,implementation or behaviour of system and application.An attacker can exploit to gain access 
		to unauthorised information or to perform unauthorised actions. A vulnerability occur due to many factors,implementing a poor design of system and intended to user 
		actions.
		
		Five main categories of vulnerabilities  :
		1)Operating System :
			These type of vulnerability occur within OS and often result in privilege escalation.
		2)(Mis)configured-based :
			These type of vulnerability stem from incorrectly configured application and service. for ex, a website exposing a customers details,
		3)Weak and default credentials :
			Application and service have authetication come with  default credentials when installed. for ex,administration have come with default username and password
			like 'admin'.These are easy to guess for attacker.
		4)Application logic :
			These type of vulnerability occur due to implementing poor designed of aplication. for ex,poorly authentications mechanisms that may be result able to
			attacker to impersonate a user.
		5)Human-factor :
			These type of vulnerability occur due to human behaviour.for ex phishing sites or emails are designed to trick humans to think they are legitimate.
	
	Questions : 1)An attacker has been able to upgrade the permissions of their system account from "user" to "administrator". What type of vulnerability is this?
	---> Operating System
	2)You manage to bypass a login panel using cookies to authenticate. What type of vulnerability is this?
	---> Application logic
	
	
	♦️SCORING VULNERABILITIES(CVSS & VPR) :
		Vulnerability scoring plays a vital role in vulnerability management and is used to determine potential risk and impact of vulnerability thats on network and 
		computer system.
		There are two common framework :
		
		1)CVSS (Commaon vulnerability scoring system) :
			It was firstly introduced in 2005 ans is a very popular framework is used to design vulnerability scoring and its current version is CVSSv3.
			A vulnerability is a given a classification depending on that is have been assigned.
			
			Rating                                            Score
			
			none                                                0
			low                                                 0.1-3.9
			medium                                              4.0-6.9
			high                                                7.0-8.9
			critical                                            9.0-10.0
			
			
		2)VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating) :
			The VPR is a modern framework in vulnerability management developed by tenable for industry solution on vulnerability management.VPR is much similar to 
			CVSS .VPR doesn't have "none/informational" categories because VPR use a different scoring method.VPR is consider 150 factor when calculating risk and its
			not a open-source.VPR does not consider CIA traid meaning CIA of data does not play a large factor during vulnerability scoring when using VPR.
			
			Rating                                             Score
			
			low                                                0.1-3.9
			medium                                             4.0-6.9
			high                                               7.0-8.9
			critical                                           9.0-10.0
			
			
	Questions : 1)What year was the first iteration of CVSS published?
	---> 2005
	2)If you wanted to assess vulnerability based on the risk it poses to an organisation, what framework would you use? Note: We are looking for the acronym here.
        ---> VPR
        3)If you wanted to use a framework that was free and open-source, what framework would that be? Note: We are looking for the acronym here.
        ---> CVSS
        
        
        
        ♦️VULNERABILITY DATABASES :
        	There are resources that keep that track of vulnerabilities for all sorts of software,OS and more. we will explore some website following :

        	1)NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
        	2)Exploit-DB
        	
        	1)NVD :
        		National Vulnerability Database is a website that published all type of vulnerability details. In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities classified under Common 
        		Vulnerability and Exposures. CVE has formatting CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER.for ex, Wannacry malware was CVE-2017-0144.
        		
        	2)Exploit-DB :
        		Exploit-DB is a resource or its retains exploit for software or application stored under the name,author and version of software and application.
        		
        Questions : 1)Using NVD, how many CVEs were published in July 2021?
        ---> 1554
        2)Who is the author of Exploit-DB?
        ---> Offsec
        
        
        
        ♦️AN EXAMPLE OF FINDING A VULNERABILITY :
        	In this task we find "version disclosure" vulnerability to find to an version of an application.. With this version, we can then use Exploit-DB to search for
        	any exploits that work with that specific version. 
        	
        	For ex,we can see that the name and version number of this application is “Apache Tomcat 9.0.17”.With this information in hand, let’s use the search filter
        	on Exploit-DB to look for any exploits that may apply to “Apache Tomcat 9.0.17”.After searching Exploit-DB, there are a total of five exploits that may be useful
        	to us for this specific version of the application. 
	
	Questions : 1)What type of vulnerability did we use to find the name and version of the application in this example?
	---> Version Disclosure
	
	
	♦️SHOWING : EXPLOITING ACKME'S APPLICATION :
		It is your first week at ThePentestingCo as a Jr. Penetration tester. To ease into the role, you are shadowing a Sr. Penetration tester on your first engagement.
		The Sr. Penetration tester has managed to find a vulnerability in a web application that the client (ACKme IT Services) uses.Follow the steps that the 
		Sr. Penetration tester took to ultimately exploit ACKme IT Service's infrastructure.Complete the engagement to retrieve a flag.
		
	Questions : 1)Follow along with the showcase of exploiting ACKme's application to the end to retrieve a flag. What is this flag?
	---> THM{ACKME_ENGAGEMENT}

📌EXPLOIT VULNERABILITIES  :
	
	♦️AUTOMATED VS MANUAL VULNERABILITY SCANNER :
		the vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license
		will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice
		by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses
		similar techniques as automated scanning.
		
		some vulnerabilities :
		1)Security misconfigurations :
			Security misconfigurations involve these vulnerability due to developer insights.for ex, exposing server info between an application and an attacker.
		2)Broken access control :
			These type of vulnerability that attacker is able to access part of application that they is not supposed to otherwise
		3)Insecure deserialization :
			This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it
			will then be executed.
		4)Injection :
			An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring
			(known as sanitising) input is not harmful.
			
	Questions : 1)You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay)
	---> Yay
	2)You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?
	---> Injection
	3)You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?
	---> Broken Access Control
	
	
	♦️FINDING MANUAL EXPLOIT :
		RAPID 7 :
		Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by
		type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts

		SEARCHSPLOIT :
			Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux.You are able to search searchsploit by application name
			and/or vulnerability type.
			command : searchsploit wordpress
			
	Questions :1)What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?
	---> Github
	2)You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?
	---> Searchsploit
	
	
	♦️EXAMPLE OF MANUAL EXPLOITATION :
		In that we are going to perform remote code execution that we do in task 2 to be able to remotely execute commands on the vulnerable machine.
		For ex, we create a file name as exploit.py inside that we reflect IP address of machine that we are attacking from.
		
		Modifying an exploit before :
			nano exploit.py
			mymachine="192.168.39.24"
			port="1337"
			
		Modifying an exploit after :	
			nano exploit.py
			mymachine="10.22.232.22"
			port="1337"
			
		Once we configuied an exploit correctly then read this exploit that how to use it.for ex,we need to provide two arguments when running the exploit:
		exploit.py --help
                To use this exploit, provide the following arguments:
                -u The URL of the application
                -c the command that you wish to execute 
                
                So we are ready to use this exploit on vulnerable machine.we are going to do following :
                1)Use the exploit to upload a malicious file to the vulnerable application containing whatever command we wish to execute, where the web server will run 
                this malicious file to execute the code.
                2)The file will first contain a basic command that we will use to verify that the exploit has worked.
                3)Then we are going to read the contents of a file located on the vulnerable machine.
                
                Running the exploit to output the name of the user that the application is running as :
                exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "whoami"
                
                Running the exploit to output the contents of a file on the target machine :
                exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "cat flag.txt"
                
        Questions : 1)What type of vulnerability was used in this attack?
        ---> Remote Code Execution
        
        
        ♦️PRACTICAL : MANAUL EXPLOITATION :	
        	navigating to http://10.201.112.74 in the browser of the device connected to the THM network.
        	
 	Questions : 1)Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?
 	---> see on main page for version
 	Answer : online book store v1.0
 	2)Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?
 	---> 1) create a file name as exploit.py
 	     2) Go to exploit-db website and search online book store. there is online book store unauthenticated RCE inside there is code to exploit this vulnerability
 	     3) copy this code and paste into exploit.py and in help argument define target and save it.
 	     4) type command in terminal : python3 exploit.py <target-ip> you will get an shell and use cat command to see the flag.
